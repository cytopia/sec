# Syscalls

https://www.slashroot.in/what-is-system-call-in-unix-and-linux

* `\x080` is reserved for system calls in `EAX` register
* `EBX`, `ECX`, `EDX`, ... are agruments for system calls

The register name might differ in 64 bit Intel processors (in the case of 64 bit instead of EAX, a register named RAX will be used for storing system call number).
